## Game Concept
EcoQuest begins with ordinary characters living peaceful lives. However, as they sleep, they mysteriously time-travel to a future where ecosystems have collapsed, biodiversity has vanished, and the atmosphere is so compromised that people must wear masks. In this dystopian future, reaching the age of 30 is rare unless one is exceptionally healthy.

The characters witness the devastating impact of today’s actions—such as carbon emissions and resource exploitation—and are motivated to act. They return to the present and engage in environmental restoration activities like **bioremediation of polluted rivers** and **afforestation**, all with the goal of preventing the catastrophic future they witnessed.

The game features a repeating cycle: after completing tasks in the present, players fall asleep and revisit the future. There, they see gradual improvements—like once-dry rivers beginning to flow again—showcasing the positive effects of sustainable actions.

## Key Features
